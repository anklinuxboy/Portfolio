### Open Source Personal Portfolio Website released under MIT License 2020.

I designed the website to work on mobile as well as desktop following the responsive design principles.

**Things you'll need to update :-**
1) Profile pic.
2) Update the background image if you want to.
3) Update the social links (add or delete as per your use case).
4) Update the sections.

This is a very simple bare bones website utilizing HTML & CSS only. The goal was to have something quick out there without spending too much time on it. You can check out the website at [www.ankitsharma.dev](https://www.ankitsharma.dev)

I host my website on Google Cloud. I got the domain name from Google Domains. Google makes it really easy to integrate their domain name service with App Engine. It also generates a SSL certificate for you so that users don't see Chrome complaining about the security of the website which creates a not so great UX.

I followed these links to setup App Engine for a static website :-
